# AENE Project Repository

This repository contains the AENE project, which focuses on integrating cutting-edge blockchain technologies. The project is divided into two main components: one utilizing Scroll and the other utilizing Maschain.

## Table of Contents

- [Scroll Integration](#scroll-integration)
- [Maschain Integration](#maschain-integration)

## Scroll Integration

### Overview
The Scroll component of the AENE project is designed to leverage the Scroll zkEVM, enabling scalable and secure smart contract execution. This part of the project focuses on optimizing transaction throughput while maintaining Ethereum-level security.

### Features
- **zkEVM Implementation:** Utilize the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) for smart contract execution.
- **Optimized Transaction Throughput:** Achieve higher transaction speeds without compromising security.
- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based applications.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Scroll integration:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AENE.git
   cd AENE/scroll-integration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy --network scroll
   ```

4. Test the integration:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Maschain Integration

### Overview
The Maschain component focuses on leveraging Maschain's high-performance blockchain architecture. This part of the project is aimed at developing decentralized applications (DApps) with low latency and high scalability.

### Features
- **High-Performance Blockchain:** Utilize Maschain's architecture for fast and scalable DApp development.
- **Decentralized Applications:** Build and deploy DApps that can handle high transaction volumes.
- **Advanced Security:** Implement cutting-edge security features to protect user data and transactions.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Maschain integration:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AENE.git
   cd AENE/maschain-integration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Deploy DApps:
   ```bash
   maschain-cli deploy --network maschain
   ```

4. Test the integration:
   ```bash
   maschain-cli test
   ```
